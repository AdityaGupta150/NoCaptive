# NoCaptive
Python Script to automate login to captive portal, no browser needed, auto logouts

If you want it to run the script at startup (for that your PC should), just create a bash file to run the python script, then set the bash file to run at startup (for windows, it was having a shortcut of the bash file in Startup folder)
